# Predicting Probability of Developing Diseases

For my summer internship, I worked on a project where I had to predict the probability of developing a disease for an individual. I have used the healthcareai library package on R for this problem. I have also used a ggplot to visualize the data. Here, I am predicting the probability of 3 diseases for each individual. The diseases are Diabetes, Hypertension, and Coronary Heart Disease. I have uploaded a short code of my work as the work was confidential.

**Programming:** R

**Packages:** Healthcareai, ggplot

To start, I build multiple models for diseases to see the probability of each disease. I split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%). I also plotted graphs to interpret the model better. There were many variables in the model so I performed a variable importance test to understand the significance of each variable. Later, I tested the model on the testing data set and later evaluated the model using multiple evaluation metrics.
